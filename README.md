I am a male, 18, computer science student from Bangalore, India. I like to listen and play instruments and occasionally watch movies and sports. I also am a self proclaimed foosball pro :). 
I am currently enrolled in Coursera's Google IT Automation Course. This is to enhance my coding abilities in the language of Python. I also have a decent working knowledge of Java and OOP. However, I also plan to dive deeper to learn more in this regard.
In terms of front-end development, I am familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
