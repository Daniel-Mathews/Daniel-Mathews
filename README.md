I am a male, 18, computer science student from Bangalore, India. I like to listen and play instruments and occasionally watch the news and sports. I also am a self proclaimed foosball pro :). 

I am currently enrolled in QC101 from Udemy. Through this, I intend to gain insight into the world of Quantum Computing. I also have a decent working knowledge of core Java and OOP. However, I also plan to dive deeper to learn more in this regard.

In terms of front-end development, I am familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
