I am a male, 18, computer science student from Bangalore, India. I like to listen and play instruments and occasionally watch the news and sports. I also am a self proclaimed foosball pro :). 

I am a Quantum Computing enthusiast and am actively working to gain knowledge in this budding field. I have finished Qbronze and am looking forward to attending the upcoming Womanium workshop along with the Qiskit Summer School in July. I'm thrilled to share that I've been selected as a QIntern this year, and will be working on a project for the next two months with Zeki Seskir. I also have a decent working knowledge of core Java and OOP. However, it is my plan to dive deeper to learn more in this regard.

In terms of front-end development, I am familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Python3.
